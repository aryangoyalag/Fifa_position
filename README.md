Starting from FIFA 20, EA Sports has given the option to gamers to create their own players. Pick any player – the race and gender you pick don’t matter here. 
In the customization section of FIFA 20, you’re able to fully design your own player. You can choose what clothes your player wears, but the tabs at the top also allow you to customize their name, sex, race, and appearance.

Apart from choosing skin, you can also change player attributes like stamina, dribbling, goalkeeping reflexes, ball control. These attributes will change player behavior on the soccer field. Also, the player's best position will also change.

We will be using machine learning to predict the best position for this newly created player. We will train a
model on current players' attributes and their current playing positions.
